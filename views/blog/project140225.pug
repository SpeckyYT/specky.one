    p.
        I went skiing and saw a "Saint Valentine's Party" poster, and I came up with an idea.
        I will ask out random girls on Discord and see if I can get anyone to hang out with me on Saint Valentine's day.
    
    code.inline 10/02/25
    p.
        I started looking at a lot of discord profiles, finding someone who was clearly showing feminine traits in their 'about me'.
        I ended up making a quite small list of people.
    
    code.inline 11/02/25
    p.
        I wrote a message with all of the informations, when I'd be available (14/02 and 15/02), what we could play, and everything.
        I started sending out the messages to a few of them.

        Surprisingly, I got a response in less than an hour later.
        She said she's 16 and rejected the offer.

    code.inline 12/02/25
    p.
        Nobody else responded yet... I panicked, only two days remained...
        I sent out a few more messages to some people I scrolled through at random on phone.

        Two girls responded, both rejections.
        The first one responded that she's taken and happy.
        The second one said that she already has a valentine.

        But out of nowhere, not even two minutes after I sent the message, a girl wrote "Sure!".
        Perfect, I had a valentine!

    code.inline 13/02/25
    p.
        I notified the person that accepted, that I won't be available on the 15/02.

        Another girl responded saying "drop 300", and I was unsure what she meant, so I asked her, and she wrote "$300".
        I responded that someone already reserved me to be their valentine.
        She responded "gtfo dummy u a loser; like ong u lying".
        I do not really condone this behaviour, I tried to be nice and the best thing I was expecting is for someone to say either yes or no, but this is not something I accept, so I blocked her.

        A girl DMed me "Who are you?" (I was already at sleep at this time)

    code.inline 14/02/25
    p.
        I responded to the "Who are you?" question with a "I... am Steve" gif, I thought it was quite funny.
        We had a short conversation about VR stuff, but she sadly was not available for hanging around.

        The girl that accepted sadly declined, she wasn't home.

        So yeah, I ended up being alone on saint valentine's day. I joined a vocal chat and started writing this blog.
    
    code.inline 15/02/25
    p.
        I DMed all of the girls who did not respond with "if you're reading this at a later date, I hope you had a great saint valentine day!".

        I contacted some friends of mine telling how poorly this project went.

        I finished writing this blog, and this is about everything.
